# 3D-Airplane-Game


This repository contains a simple airplane game developed using Three.js and Cannon-es. The game was created as a learning project to understand the basics of 3D graphics rendering and physics simulation in web applications.

## Overview

In this game, the player controls an airplane navigating through a cityscape, avoiding collisions with buildings. The game features basic 3D modeling, physics integration, and interactive controls. The primary goal is to avoid buildings while the airplane automatically advances, increasing speed and score as time progresses.

## Features

- **Three.js Rendering**: Utilizes Three.js for 3D graphics rendering including geometries, materials, and lighting.
- **Cannon-es Physics**: Implements Cannon-es for physics simulation to handle the airplane's movement and collision detection with buildings.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Buildings are generated dynamically with varying heights and positions.
- **Score System**: A scoring system that increases as the airplane avoids buildings and the game progresses.
- **Game Over Scenario**: Includes a game over condition when the airplane collides with a building, displaying a restart button to reload the game.

## Setup

To run this project, you'll need a modern web browser that supports WebGL. No external installations are required as the game runs entirely in the browser.

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.
3. Use the arrow keys to navigate the airplane:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right

## Learning Objectives

This project was developed as a personal learning endeavor in Three.js and Cannon-es. Key learning aspects include:

- Basic setup of a 3D scene using Three.js.
- Integration of physics with 3D graphics using Cannon-es.
- Handling user input for interactive controls.
- Implementing game logic like scoring and game over conditions.

## Future Enhancements

While the current game serves as a basic prototype, potential enhancements could include:

- Enhanced graphics and textures.
- Addition of sound effects and background music.
- More complex obstacle behaviors and varied game mechanics.
- Mobile responsiveness and touch controls.
